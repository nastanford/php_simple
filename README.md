# php_simple
Trying to just build a simple framework with as little code as possible. If you want to help let me know.

## File: httpd-vhosts.conf 
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/php_simple/public"
    ServerName php_simple.test
</VirtualHost>
```

## File: hosts
``` 127.0.0.1         php_simple.test ```
